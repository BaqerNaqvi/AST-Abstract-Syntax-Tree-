# Mendix expression evaluator

This repo contains code to execute a custom AST(Abstract Syntax Tree) format.

## Development

To start, run `npm install`.

## Unit Tests

Run `npm run tests`

# Documentation

Mendix developers building apps can write short expressions in their apps. An expression can be as simple as `true` or more complex such as `1 + 1 != 3`.
These expressions are parsed and converted to an AST in JSON format. The documentation for the complete expression syntax can be found [here](https://docs.mendix.com/refguide/expressions). This repo contains a simple evaluator that can execute the AST for a very small subset of the Mendix expressions.

## AST Specification

The AST can contain different types of nodes. Type of a node is specified by the `type` field. An AST type can either be `literal` or `function`.

### Literal Expression

Literals represent constant values specified in an expression.

```javascript
{
    type: "literal",
    value: "test"
}
```

#### value

This field can hold a JavaScript string, boolean, number, Date, `null`, or an Array containing the same primitives.

### Function Expression

Functions represent an operation that accept zero or more parameters and return a value.

```javascript
{
    type: "function",
    name: "function_name",
    parameters: [Expression1, Expression2, ...]
}
```

#### name

The operation to be performed on the parameters.

#### parameters

Zero or more sub-expression(s).

#### Return value

A function can return one of the following types: string, boolean, number, Date, `null`, or an Array containing the same primitives.

## Examples

```javascript
// Expression: 40 + 2
// AST:
{
    type: "function",
    name: "add",
    parameters: [
        {
            type: "literal",
            value: 40
        },
        {
            type: "literal",
            value: 2
        }
    ]
}

// Expression: 1 + 2 != 3
// AST:
{
    type: "function",
    name: "not",
    parameters: [
        {
            type: "function",
            name: "equals",
            parameters: [
                {
                    type: "function",
                    name: "add",
                    parameters: [
                        {
                            type: "literal",
                            value: 1
                        },
                        {
                            type: "literal",
                            value: 2
                        },
                    ]
                },
                {
                    type: "literal",
                    value: 3
                }
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```

## The Implementation

This assignment contains an implementation of the specification above. The `functions.js` contains three functions:

- `equals` function that should return whether the two arguments passed to it are equal or not.
- `add` function that should return a sum of all passed arguments.
- `not` function that should return `false` if the input parameter is `true` or return `true` if the input parameter is `false`.

The `evaluator.js` contains the main component that evaluates an expression's AST.

## The Assignment

In this assignment, we ask you to improve the this implementation and adding some new functionality.

- This implementation is poorly done and we could use your help. The code in this assignment can be improved in various ways. Please review the code and improve where you think it is necessary. Also consider extending the unit tests. We value not just functional improvements, but also the non-functional aspects such as quality, readability and extensibility. We expect you to return the assignment on a level that you consider "production-ready".
- Implement new functionality. Support evaluating the following expression: `contains(fetchGet("https://google.com"), "Bing")`. Please note that we don't expect you to parse this string into an AST, but support evaluating it. (You can use its AST below)
  - A function called `fetchGet` which can retrieve the contents of a given URL with a GET call and return as string.
  - A function called `contains` that accepts two string arguments and returns if the first argument contains the second argument.
  - After implementing the functions, the evaluator should able to evaluate the following AST:

```javascript
// contains(fetchGet("https://google.com"), "Bing")
{
  "type": "function",
  "name": "contains",
  "parameters": [
    {
      "type": "function",
      "name": "fetchGet",
      "parameters": [
        {
          "type": "literal",
          "value": "https://google.com"
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      "type": "literal",
      "value": "Bing"
    }
  ]
}
```

You can create a new bundle with `git bundle create assignment.bundle --all` command after you're done with the assignment. (Don't forget to commit your work first) and send it back.

Good luck!
